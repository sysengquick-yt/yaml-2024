- This is a string value without quotes
- "This is a string value with quotes"
- This string spans multiple lines.
  A single line break is the same as a space.
  Handy for breaking up long strings.
- This is the first line in my string.

  This is the second line.
  This is part of the second line still.

  This is the third line.
  Don't use this style.
  It will just confuse people.
- "If you want to break up a line, but don't want the spa\
  ce, use quotes and add a backslash at the end of the line."
